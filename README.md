🗳️ Vote Integrity Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides an educational and ethical toolkit for understanding how vote-tracking systems work, how irregularities can be detected, and how digital audits can be performed.
It does not generate or support fake votes—everything here is intended for research, learning, and simulation only.

📌 About the Project

Modern voting systems rely on secure data handling, transparency, and verification.
This project offers resources to help students, researchers, and developers learn about:

Simulated voting datasets

Pattern recognition in vote logs

Duplicate-entry detection

Basic anomaly-flagging techniques

Data integrity best practices

These simulations help demonstrate how fraudulent patterns can be detected—not how to create them.

🎯 Purpose

✔ Educational demonstrations
✔ Research on dataset integrity
✔ Practice for auditing and analysis
✔ Understanding how vote anomalies appear in data
✘ Not for real elections
✘ Not for manipulation or unethical usage
